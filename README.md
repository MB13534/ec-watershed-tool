This application was developed using the LRE Starter Kit Map. This starter kit represents a common structure for a web application and consists of backend API (server side) and frontend single page application (client side). The backend API that handles all of the data while the frontend is the actual application that the user interacts with in their web browser.

More information on the Starter kit can be found on the [LRE Knowledge Base](https://lre-knowledge-base.netlify.app/).

## :herb: Getting Started

To run this application locally or to start developing, clone this repository to you own machine. After you have the repository cloned to local machine, open in it up in your text editor of choice (my personal preference is VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)). You will notice that there is a frontend and backend directory. In VS Code, open up a new terminal window by clicking on the terminal menu option and selecting `new terminal`.

### Install Frontend Dependencies

From the terminal, run `cd frontend && npm install`. This will navigate you into the frontend directory and install all of the project dependencies for the frontend application. If you see a message after install regarding vulnerabilities with the suggestion to run `npm audit fix`, take their advice and run `npm audit fix`.

### Install Backend Dependencies

From the terminal, navigate back to the root of the project by typing `cd ..` and hitting enter. Next, run `cd backend && npm install`. This will navigate you into the backend directory and install all of the project dependencies for the backend application. If you see a message after install regarding vulnerabilities with the suggestion to run `npm audit fix`, take their advice and run `npm audit fix`.

### Configure Environment Variables.

Now that all of the project dependencies are installed, you will need to create two new files to store some application environment variables. These files will be used to store sensitive information about our frontend and backend applications such as credentials and API keys. You will notice that there is a `.env.example` file in the root of the frontend and backend directories. Create a copy of each, renaming the files to `.env`.

Open up your new `.env` files and start replacing the `{POPULATE_ME}` placeholder values. If you are unsure of what values you should be filling in, please contact Doug Kulak at dougkulak@gmail.com.

You are now ready to start the application!

## :airplane: Starting the Application

Congrats! Everything should be good to go at this point and you should be ready to start both the frontend and backend.

### Starting the Frontend

Navigate into the `frontend` directory and run `npm start`. This will boot up the application and will open up the application frontend in a new browser window at `localhost:3000`. The application will automatically reload any time you make changes to a file. For more information about how the local development environment works, please refer to the Create React App docs at https://create-react-app.dev/.

### Starting the Backend

Navigate into the `backend` directory and run `npm run dev`. This will boot up the application and start it running on `localhost:3005`. The application will automatically reload any time you make changes to a file.

## :rocket: Publishing Changes and Deploying the Application

This application relies on Git and Github for version control. To publish changes to the application, commit your changes with a helpful commit message and then push the commit. Easy as that!

### Deploying the Frontend

We typically use Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/) to host the application frontend which makes hosting and deploying an application about as easy as it can be. To get an app deployed on Netlify, please refer to the LRE Knowledge Base at https://lre-knowledge-base.netlify.app/lre-starter-kit/getting-started/deploying-the-application. Changes to the frontend are automatically redeployed whenever a commit is pushed to the Github repository. No additional work required.

### Deploying the Backend

We typically host the application backend is hosted on Heroku (https://heroku.com). To get an app deployed on Heroku, please refer to the LRE Knowledge Base at https://lre-knowledge-base.netlify.app/lre-starter-kit/getting-started/deploying-the-application. Once the application is deployed on Heroku, the process to redeploy the API is relatively simple. After making your changes to the backend application, commit your changes with a helpful commit message and then push the commit. Next, open up a new terminal and navigate into the root of the backend directory and run the following command:

`git subtree push --prefix backend/ heroku master`

This will kick off a deploy. All you need to do at this point is sit back and wait for the re-deploy to complete.

## :hammer: Starter Kit Utilities

There are a number of handy Starter Kit utilities for common tasks such as creating new components, pages, API DB Models, and API endpoints.

### Frontend Utilities

#### Generate Files for a new Component

You can use this handy script to automatically generate and populate the boilerplate for creating a new React component. To do so, open up a terminal in VS Code, navigate into the root of the frontend directory and run the following command, replacing COMPONENT_NAME with whatever you want the component to be called:

```shell
npm run generateComponent COMPONENT_NAME
```

This will create the folder structure and boilerplate for a new React component in the `src/components` directory.

#### Generate Files for a new Page

You can use this handy script to automatically generate and populate the boilerplate for creating a new application page. To do so, open up a terminal in VS Code, navigate into the root of the frontend directory and run the following command, replacing PAGE_NAME with whatever you want the component to be called:

```shell
npm run generatePage PAGE_NAME
```

This will create the folder structure and boilerplate for a new application page in the `src/page` directory.

### Backend Utilities

#### Generate API Resources

You can use this handy script to generate both API Models and Endpoinnts. This script is particularly useful for setting up a new model and endpoints related to managing a list table. It can still be useful for setting up some boilerplate for other use cases though.
The script expects to be called with several arguments: the directory name, file name, database schema name, and the database table/view name. Behind the scenes, there is some fancy logic that looks at the table/view you provided and generates the model definition based on database object.

**Important**: The script is not currently smart enough to identify constraints and what field is the primary key, so you will still need to add that info to the model definition.

To run this script, open up a terminal in VS Code, navigate into the root of the backend directory and run the following command, replacing FOLDER_NAME, FILE_NAME, SCHEMA_NAME, and TABLE_NAME.

```shell
npm run generateAPIResource FOLDER_NAME FILE_NAME SCHEMA_NAME TABLE_NAME
```

For instance, running `npm run generateAPIResource Stations ListStations data list_stations`, would create a subdirectory in the `models` directory called Stations and create a model definition file called ListStations. A Stations directory would also be created in the `routes` directory.

#### Generate Model

You can use this handy script to generate an API Model definition file. The script expects to be called with several arguments: the directory name, file name, database schema name, and the database table/view name. Behind the scenes, there is some fancy logic that looks at the table/view you provided and generates the model definition based on database object.

**Important**: The script is not currently smart enough to identify constraints and what field is the primary key, so you will still need to add that info to the model definition.

To run this script, open up a terminal in VS Code, navigate into the root of the backend directory and run the following command, replacing FOLDER_NAME, FILE_NAME, SCHEMA_NAME, and TABLE_NAME.

```shell
npm run generateModel FOLDER_NAME FILE_NAME SCHEMA_NAME TABLE_NAME
```

For instance, running `npm run generateModel Stations ListStations data list_stations`, would create a subdirectory in the `models` directory called Stations and create a model definition file called ListStations.
